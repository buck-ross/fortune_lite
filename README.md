## Database Locations

Unlike other fortune programs, Fortune Lite is designed to parse fortunes out of specialized SQLite databases. By default, the Fortune Lite program looks for a database at *~/.fortune.db*, and falls back to the prepackaged database if not database is found in the user's home directory.  
Additionally, the `$FORTUNE_DB` environment variable can be used to override the default database locations, in which case the fortune program will only fall back to the default locations in the event that no database is found at the location stored in `$FORTUNE_DB`.

## Credit to [fortune-mod](https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod)

While *Fortune Lite* is a completely distinct and independent project from *fortune-mod*, we do currently use the datfile sources provided by *fortune-mod* in order to generate the SQLite fortune database. As such, the *fortune-mod* project deserves all credit for creating and maintaing the default fortune database.
